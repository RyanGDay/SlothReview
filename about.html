      You might not remember, but a few years ago there was that movie you really wanted to see. The commercial looked amazing and you really meant to call your friends.
      But you got busy, didn't have a date, and you were running low on cash. Before you knew it the theater had moved on to the next blockbuster and you had missed your chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fast-forward to now and you still don't have a date (for reasons we won't get into), so you're at home on Friday night scrolling through Netflix. You see a title and it
      kind of rings a bell; it piques your interest. You read the description and it's deja-vu! This is the film you wanted to see!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make up for lost time, but should you waste a couple hours on a movie that's past it's prime in a social context? Plus, there's a rumor that new Netflix original
      series is really good, but that might lend itself to a binge...
