        <h1><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/" target="_blank" title="Arrival on IMDB">Baby Driver</a></h1>
        <h4>2016 - Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker</h4>
        <p>
          Louise Banks (Adams) is at the top of her field as a college professor and linguist expert when an alien pod touches down and the US Government comes a knockin' for help.
          Banks is called on by Colonel Weber (played by Forest Whitaker) and is introduced to another expert in physics, Ian Donnelly (Renner). She is briefed that a total of 12 pods
          have come to earth and countries around the world are trying to determine why. Donnelly, for one, would like to gain more information about the alien race and their technological
          advances, but first they must learn the language of the alien race.<br /><br />
          As the aliens uses symbols to communicate the purpose of their visit is slow for everyone to determine. Military powers such as Russia and China believe they have come to take over,
          while other countries just want to learn from the aliens. Inevitably tension around the world towards the pods and their inhabitants rise to a boiling point and line of
          information/communication between countries are shut off. The dark period between countries forces Banks and Donnelly to push even harder to figure out this language and find out
          why the aliens are here. <br /><br />
          Although this movie falls into your basic Sci-Fi category with the aliens, it goes much deeper and really builds a relationship between the audience and Banks. There are several cut-aways
          to interactions between Banks and her daughter who we find out, at the beginning of the movie, dies at a young age. At first these cut-aways seem like they could be figments of a sleep
          deprived scientist, but in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie everything get wrapped into a nice little package leaving the viewer something to dwell on. If you could see your whole life
          from start to finish, would you change things?<br /><br />

        <h4>2017 - Ansel Elgort, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx</h4>
        <p>
          Ansel Elgort (normally seen next to Shailene Woodley in the Divergent Series/The Fault in our Starts) stars as Baby, a free wheeling get-away driver
          that has a hearing impairment and an affinity for music. He is the constant as Doc (Spacey) puts together different crews for different robbery schemes.
          We soon find out that although everyone get their cut, Baby is in Doc's pocket and is working to pay off a debt. With Batts (Foxx) playing the role of wild man,
          the heists feel like they are moving towards greater and greater danger. Just when Baby thinks he's about to get out, he gets pulled back in for one more job.<br /><br />
          The movie is a good mix of action, love story, and time spent building the characters to keep you interested. With some bigger names in this film,
          the spotlight is stolen by the eclectic music that is sure to keep your toes tapping while you're enjoying this Oscar nominated film. <br /><br />

        <h1><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5566790/" target="_blank" title="A Futile and Stupid Gesture on IMDB">A Futile and Stupid Gesture</a></h1>
        <h4>2018 - Will Forte, Martin Mull, Domhnall Gleeson, Joel McHale</h4>
        <p>
          A Futile and Stupid Gesture is the story of Doug Kenney, who along with good friend Henry Beard, started National Lampoon after graduating from Harvard
          in the late 60's where they had written for the Harvard Lampoon. National Lampoon was originally a satirical magazine, but eventually expanded into radio and movies.
          They hired other comedians and comedy writers they knew, many of whom went on to large comedy careers of their own, including Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Gilda Radner
          and Bill Murray. National Lampoon's staff eventually gets hired away to become the original cast of SNL, which speaks to Kenney and Beard's eye for comedic talent.<br /><br />
          Where Henry Beard's sense of humor is more refined and sensible, Kenney is a free spirit and wild card, often running with any outlandish idea. As National Lampoon's
          success sky rockets, Kenney struggles under the pressure and takes an absence to refresh himself. When he returns he finds he's fallen out of sync with the magazine
          and instead begins work on other projects, eventually helping to write and produce Animal House, the highest grossing comedy movie of it's time. Despite his success,
          Kenney struggles to legitimize his career to his parents, aristocrats, who expected he would do more with an Ivy League education. He's also unable to hold a
          romantic relationship together. Unfortunately, Kenney's success also fund his drug and alcohol addictions leading him to a rehab center in Hawaii where he meets
          his untimely and somewhat mysterious demise.<br /><br />
          This was a really, really unique movie as it's a true story, it's narrated on screen, and walks a line between documentary and comedy. There's also not another movie like
          this one in the fact that there are so many recognizable names. There are both recognizable names because of the comedians and actors cast in the movie and also the
          recognizable comedians they are pretending to be. The ultimate example of this was watching Joel McHale, who co-starred with an older Chevy Chase on the tv series Community,
          play a young and wild Chevy Chase for the movie. McHale nailed Chase's demeanor and physical comedy. Will Forte was also perfect for the lead part as he can continue to
          be quirky and deliver one-liners ad nauseum without it becoming overly tiring. In that regard the movie was reminiscent of Airplane where every other line is a cheap
          joke, only for these guys, it was real life. As a viewer, you want to engage in this banter yourself and end up wishing you were half as witty.<br /><br />
          Besides Will Forte and Joel McHale the movie includes Martin Mull, Matt Walsh, Thomas Lennon, Joe Lo Truglio, Emmy Rossum and at least a dozen other cameos.
          Famouse people being portrayed in the film include the aforementioned SNL cast, Lorne Michaels, Harold Ramis, and Rodney Dangerfield.
          The ultimate way to describe it is a bunch of comedians portraying the comedians that came before them, and telling their story. That alone makes it worth watching
          despite a slight and momentarly somber ending.

      <div class="review" id="LaLaLand">
        <h1><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/" target="_blank" title="La La Land on IMDB">La La Land</a></h1>
        <h4>2016 - Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone</h4>
        <p>
          La La Land was a delightful piece of movie magic. A thoroughly enjoyable film.<br /><br />
          Sebastian and Mia (Gosling and Stone) are both down and out on their luck in Hollywood. Mia is hoping that the right opportunity falls in her lap, but after so many failed auditions,
          she is ready to call it quits on becoming an actress. Sebastian is going to make his own opportunity to be a successful jazz musician, but it's going to be on his terms, and ultimately
          his ambitions might be bigger than his budget. They accidentally cross paths several times before getting to know each other and becoming romantic. Supporting each others efforts might
          ultimately make them both successful.<br /><br />
          Part of what made the movie fun to watch was the costumes and scenes that made you forget it's a modern story. Stretches of the movie looked like they could have been from
          the 40s or 50s and it isn't until they reference a Prius or use a cell-phone that you're reminded it's 2016. It was a very clever trick and helps build all this nostalgia for Hollywood.
          La La Land was somewhat overt in the fact that it was a Hollywood-centric movie, but somehow that worked.<br /><br />
          While La La Land is technically a musical, they don't bash the viewer over the head with musical number after musical number. The musical scenes were fun, but the bulk of the movie
          functions as a normal plot. While Gosling and Stone were both believable in song and dance, it was occassionally difficult to discern the lyrics.<br /><br />
          Music, romance and Ryan Gosling... Cuddle up to your significant other and enjoy.

        <h1><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/" target="_blank" title="John Wick on IMDB">John Wick</a></h1>
        <h4>2014 - Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Bridget Moynahan, John Leguizamo</h4>
        <p>
          Despite the number of well-known actors in the film, I probably could have just stopped after Keanu Reeves. This movie says the run-time is 1 hr 41 mins,
          but let me tell you, with about 20 minutes of dialogue and techno pumping gun fight scenes all throughout this flick moves quick.<br><br>
          The first 10 minutes of the film builds the background for who John Wick is and how he's gotten to this point in his life. He was a hit man who got out of the game
          and married the love of his life (Moynahan). Through a collection of flashbacks, his wife tragically dies but it's when a son of a gangster from the Eastern Bloc
          (played by the redhead from the Iron Islands for you GOTers out there) kills his dog that shit gets real. It is at that point that Wick comes out of retirement to absolutely
          wreck shop. As the film moves you learn more who Wick can trust and realize quickly that this is not going to end well for a bunch of dudes.<br><br>
          If you've got some free time and are in the mood for a thoughtless stream of non-stop violent action set to techno, be sure to check this one out.<br><br>

      <div class="review" id="Burnt">
        <h1><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2503944/" target="_blank" title="Burnt on IMDB">Burnt</a></h1>
        <h4>2015 - Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl</h4>
        <p>
          Burnt is a film starring Bradley Cooper as Adam Jones, a chef with a sordid past and is now on a barn-storming comeback tour to make amends, best his rival and restore glory to
          his name. His ultimate goal is achieving a 3-star Michelin rating. Michelin reviews are kind of like Yelp, but on paper and only for super fancy restaurants.
          Along the way Jones finds that the bridges he has burned in his past come back to burn him.<br><br>
          If you've seen any of the Netflix series Chef's Table, this is like an episode of Chef's Table starring an American version of Gordon Ramsay, crossed with a bad daytime soap-opera.
          While some movies rely on flashbacks to give the viewer more background, Burnt relies mostly on just dropping in details in conversation and through characters.
          That's not a bad thing necessarily, but it became too much the focus of the movie.  The backstory of Adam Jones ended up sounding like a more entertaining movie than what was
          actually happening on the screen.<br><br>
          One other drawback was the number of storylines going on simultaneously, but also never really fully developing any of them. Jones is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict;
          He's got drug debts that criminals are demanding he pay; He's making amends with Tony, the son of his deceased mentor Jean-Luc; Momentarily it looks like Jones and Tony might become romantic,
          until you find out Jones has a romantic past with Tony's sister Anne Marie; He's falling for his own sous chef while almost rekindling the flame with Anne Marie;
          He's busy exchanging insults with his nemesis who also worked under Jean-Luc. All of this while he's still trying to achieve that 3-star rating, which
          is one of the few storylines to really come to some conclusion. It should have been the focus, but lost time to the other plots.<br><br>
          In the end, Burnt is still the title of the film, but also how the viewer is left feeling.

      <div class="review" id="WhyHim">
        <h1><a href="http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4501244/" target="_blank" title="Why Him? on IMDB">Why Him?</a></h1>
        <h4>2016 - James Franco, Bryan Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan Mullaly, Cedric The Entertainer</h4>
        <p>
          James Franco, a talented actor he may be, is at his best when playing a total buffoon, and that's what makes this movie so satisfying. This movie is your classic parents vs. new
          boyfriend style plot, pitting the straight-laced father, Ned Fleming (Cranston), against the free-spirit boyfriend Laird Mayhew (Franco). Ned and Laird couldn't be more different.
          Ned owns a sinking paper printing company and likes the band KISS. Laird found his riches digitally and parties with Steve Aoki. It's up to Ned's daughter Stephanie (Deutch) to bridge the gap
          between them and bring the family together for Christmas.<br><br>
          The Flemings in this scenario are fish out of water while spending the holiday at Laird's mansion. Laird made a fortune at a young age with a series of mobile games. Laird's never had a father
          figure growing up and his relationship with his mother is strained so he's eager to make the Fleming's his new nuclear family. He attempts a number of half-thought-out but sweet meaning gestures,
          that miss the mark. And because he's loose and fast with his wealth and decision making, he can continue to make mistakes to the delight of the audience.<br /><br />
          Cranston does a great job playing the old-school father without being too rigid in the role while Franco's enthusiasm as the black-sheep keeps things unpredictable. One character that was
          close but seemed slightly over the top was Laird's assistant Gustav played by Keegan-Michael Key. The absurdity of Laird's lifestyle also allows for several fun cameos along the way including
          the aforementioned Steve Aoki, Elon Musk, and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of KISS.<br /><br />
          The fact that the plot takes place leading up to Christmas is just an excuse for the family to meet the boyfriend in this one, so it's probably not worth re-watching every December, but it
          is worth watching once just for the cheap laughs.
