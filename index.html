    <h1><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2503944/" target="_blank" title="Burnt on IMDB">Burnt</a></h1>
    <h4>2015 - Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Daniel Bruhl</h4>
    <p>
      Burnt is a film starring Bradley Cooper as Adam Jones, a chef with a sordid past and is now on a barn-storming comeback tour to make amends, best his rival and restore glory to
      his name. His ultimate goal is achieving a 3-star Michelin rating. Michelin reviews are kind of like Yelp, but on paper and only for super fancy restaurants.
      Along the way Jones finds that the bridges he has burned in his past come back to burn him.<br><br>
      If you've seen any of the Netflix series Chef's Table, this is like an episode of Chef's Table starring an American version of Gordon Ramsay, crossed with a bad daytime soap-opera.
      While some movies rely on flashbacks to give the viewer more background, Burnt relies mostly on just dropping in details in conversation and through characters.
      That's not a bad thing necessarily, but it became too much the focus of the movie.  The backstory of Adam Jones ended up sounding like a more entertaining movie than what was
      actually happening on the screen.<br><br>
      One other drawback was the number of storylines going on simultaneously, but also never really fully developing any of them. Jones is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict;
      He's got drug debts that criminals are demanding he pay; He's making amends with Tony, the son of his deceased mentor Jean-Luc; Momentarily it looks like Jones and Tony might become romantic,
      until you find out Jones has a romantic past with Tony's sister Anne Marie; He's falling for his own sous chef while almost rekindling the flame with Anne Marie;
      He's busy exchanging insults with his nemesis who also worked under Jean-Luc. All of this while he's still trying to achieve that 3-star rating, which
      is one of the few storylines to really come to some conclusion. It should have been the focus, but lost time to the other plots.<br><br>
      In the end, Burnt is still the title of the film, but also how the viewer is left feeling.

    <h1><a href="http://http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4501244/" target="_blank" title="Why Him? on IMDB">Why Him?</a></h1>
    <h4>2016 - James Franco, Bryan Cranston, Zoey Deutch, Megan Mullaly, Cedric The Entertainer</h4>
    <p>
      James Franco, a talented actor he may be, is at his best when playing a total buffoon, and that's what makes this movie so satisfying. This movie is your classic parents vs. new
      boyfriend style plot, pitting the straight-laced father, Ned Fleming (Cranston), against the free-spirit boyfriend Laird Mayhew (Franco). Ned and Laird couldn't be more different.
      Ned owns a sinking paper printing company and likes the band KISS. Laird found his riches digitally and parties with Steve Aoki. It's up to Ned's daughter Stephanie (Deutch) to bridge the gap
      between them and bring the family together for Christmas.<br><br>
      The Flemings in this scenario are fish out of water while spending the holiday at Laird's mansion. Laird made a fortune at a young age with a series of mobile games. Laird's never had a father
      figure growing up and his relationship with his mother is strained so he's eager to make the Fleming's his new nuclear family. He attempts a number of half-thought-out but sweet meaning gestures,
      that miss the mark. And because he's loose and fast with his wealth and decision making, he can continue to make mistakes to the delight of the audience.<br /><br />
      Cranston does a great job playing the old-school father without being too rigid in the role while Franco's enthusiasm as the black-sheep keeps things unpredictable. One character that was
      close but seemed slightly over the top was Laird's assistant Gustav played by Keegan-Michael Key. The absurdity of Laird's lifestyle also allows for several fun cameos along the way including
      the aforementioned Steve Aoki, Elon Musk, and Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of KISS.<br /><br />
      The fact that the plot takes place leading up to Christmas is just an excuse for the family to meet the boyfriend in this one, so it's probably not worth re-watching every December, but it
      is worth watching once just for the cheap laughs.
