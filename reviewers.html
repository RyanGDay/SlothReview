      <h3>Dan</h3>
      <br>
      Dan's eclectic taste in cinema gives him a broad perspective when reviewing a film.

      <h3>Logan</h3>
      <br>
      Logan sees all the new stuff. Like, he actually drives to a theater and sits in the dark with strangers to watch a film.
      He is quite knowledgeable though and doesn't sugar coat something if it's not up to par.

      <h3>Ryan</h3>
      <br>
      If you don't even have to think during the movie, it's probably for Ryan.
      Comedy and quirky are his preferred genres. His wife won't watch the films he enjoys because they "contain too many awkward situations." That's a badge of pride for him.

      <h3>Walter</h3>
      <br>
      With a discerning eye, Walter can separate the wheat from the chaffe when it comes to film. He enjoys films with sleuths, crime enterprises and tasteful action scenes.
